-- 005_wacrm_crm.sql — CRM domain completion
--
-- Contacts, tags, contact_tags, custom_fields, contact_custom_values,
-- contact_notes, pipelines, pipeline_stages, deals and the
-- `contacts.phone_normalized` dedup column/index were already ported
-- in 002_wacrm_business_tables.sql; `filter_contacts_by_tags` lives
-- in 003_wacrm_functions.sql.
--
-- This file completes the CRM domain with `merge_duplicate_contacts`
-- (supabase migration 022): collapses existing normalized-phone
-- duplicates within an account, re-pointing child rows first. Used by
-- ops after a bulk import; the in-app webhook/form paths de-dup live
-- via the unique index instead. Ported without SECURITY DEFINER/RLS
-- (direct-PG runs as the app's DB owner; tenancy is app-layer via
-- account_id).
--
-- Idempotent — safe to run multiple times.
