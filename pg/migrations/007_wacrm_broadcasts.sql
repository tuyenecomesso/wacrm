-- 007_wacrm_broadcasts.sql — broadcasts domain completion
--
-- broadcasts + broadcast_recipients (with whatsapp_message_id / wamid)
-- were already ported in 002_wacrm_business_tables.sql.
--
-- This file completes the domain with the incremental broadcast
-- counter machinery (supabase migrations 003 + 005): the aggregate
-- trigger owns the broadcast count columns
-- (sent/delivered/read/replied/failed) derived purely from
-- broadcast_recipients rows, plus an ops safety-net
-- `recompute_broadcast_counts(bid)`.
--
-- The app layer depends on this trigger: broadcast-core deliberately
-- does NOT seed the count columns because the trigger would clobber
-- them on the first recipient change (see src/lib/whatsapp/
-- broadcast-core.ts). Ported without SECURITY DEFINER / RLS.
--
-- Idempotent — safe to run multiple times.
